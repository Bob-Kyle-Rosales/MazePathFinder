# MazePathFinder


- I modified the outline of the application and made it into 13x10
- In the "wall" of the maze, it will indicate a different color with an 'X' mark.
- I also added a new Informed searching algorithm called Greedy Best First Search.
- The implemented Greedy Best First Search incorporates queue behaviour with the lowest heuristic value
  to be enqueue first.
- I implemented a manhattan distance for the heuristic value that changes according
  to the destination or end path.
